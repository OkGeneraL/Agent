# SuperAgent Install Script Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The install script was failing during the Go build process with the following error:
```
internal/cli/interactive.go:25:2: missing go.sum entry for module providing package gopkg.in/yaml.v2 (imported by superagent/internal/cli); to add:
        go get superagent/internal/cli
```

## Root Cause
The codebase had inconsistent YAML package versions:
- **go.mod** declared `gopkg.in/yaml.v3 v3.0.1` as a dependency
- **Code files** were importing `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` (older version)
- This created a mismatch that caused the missing go.sum entry error during compilation

## Files Affected
1. `internal/cli/interactive.go` (line 24)
2. `internal/traefik/traefik_manager.go` (line 15)

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated YAML Package Imports
- **Before**: `"gopkg.in/yaml.v2"`
- **After**: `"gopkg.in/yaml.v3"`

### 2. Removed Unused Imports
**In `internal/cli/interactive.go`:**
- Removed: `"context"` (unused)
- Removed: `"superagent/internal/deploy"` (unused)
- Removed: `"github.com/sirupsen/logrus"` (unused)

**In `internal/traefik/traefik_manager.go`:**
- Removed: `"context"` (unused)

### 3. Updated Go Dependencies
- Ran `go mod tidy` to download and update all dependencies
- Ensured `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` is properly included in go.sum

## Verification
✅ **Build Success**: `go build -o superagent ./cmd/agent` completed without errors
✅ **Binary Created**: 26MB executable created successfully  
✅ **Functionality Test**: `./superagent version` returns expected output

## API Compatibility
The migration from yaml.v2 to yaml.v3 is safe because:
- Both files only use `yaml.Marshal()` function
- The Marshal API is identical between v2 and v3
- No breaking changes in the used functionality

## Install Script Status
The install script should now work correctly during the build phase. The original error:
```
go get superagent/internal/cli
```
is no longer needed as all dependencies are properly resolved.

## Testing Recommendations
1. Run the full install script in a clean environment
2. Verify all SuperAgent functionality works as expected
3. Test YAML configuration file processing (both Traefik and CLI components)
