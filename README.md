# SuperAgent - Enterprise Deployment Agent

## ✅ Build Status: **SUCCESSFUL**

SuperAgent is a production-ready, enterprise-grade deployment agent that provides controlled deployment capabilities similar to Vercel but with enhanced security, governance, and enterprise features.

## 🎯 What is SuperAgent?

SuperAgent is a secure deployment platform that allows deployment of **only predefined applications** from your platform, providing:

  work_dir: "/var/lib/superagent"
  data_dir: "/var/lib/superagent/data"
  
security:
  encryption_key_file: "/etc/superagent/encryption.key"
  audit_log_enabled: true
  audit_log_path: "/var/log/superagent/audit.log"
  
docker:
  host: "unix:///var/run/docker.sock"
  network_name: "superagent"
  
monitoring:
  metrics_port: 9090
  health_check_interval: "30s"
```
